# Node Event Reminder
Just a small node app running a cron to trigger event reminders for birthdays etc.

- Email via nodemailer
- SMS & WhatsApp via Twilio

### TODO
- Deploy node app to a DO droplet
- Add sentry to the node app for error tracking?
- Add a basic auth-locked settings page to allow add/edit/delete of events. Nuxt?
